## Features:

Control your paddle with the arrow keys while the computer controls the opponent's paddle.
Score tracking: Keep track of player and computer scores displayed on the game window title.
Randomized ball and computervmovements: The ball's speed and direction change randomly upon collision with paddles and so does the computer's reaction speed.
Sound effects: Enjoy chime sound effects for scoring points and background music during gameplay.

## How to Play:

Use the up and down arrow keys to move your paddle up and down, respectively.
The game ends when one player reaches a score of 5.
A message box appears announcing the winner, and the game restarts automatically.

## Customization:

Additionally you can add more features to your game such as power-ups, walls or other mechanics that make the game more engaging. Sound effects are also something else and fairly easy to add. If I would have had more time, I would have added different difficulty levels for the computer you play against.
